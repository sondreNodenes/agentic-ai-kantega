# EXERCISES:
# a) Make the orchestrator follow the RULES of a good discussion moderator:
#   "RULES:\n"
#   "1. Rotate through ALL participants - do not favor any single participant\n"
#   "2. Each participant should speak at least once before any participant speaks twice\n"
#   "3. Continue for at least {rounds_of_discussion - 1} rounds before ending the discussion\n"
#   "4. Do NOT select the same participant twice in a row"
# b) Ask the team to solve the task: "Write code that calculates the pi number."
# c) Give the Coder space: remove the limitation of keeping it short. Observe the quality of the output.
# d) Create a "critic" agent and add it to the discussion. The critic should:
#       "Provide constructive feedback. "
#       "Do not be too strict. Keep your answers somewhat short.",
