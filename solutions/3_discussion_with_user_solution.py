# EXERCISE: 
# a) Try to get the author to write a poem you like by improving the task text.
# b) If you like you can increase the discussion_rounds to give the agents more space to improve the poem.
# c) Put yourself in the team and give feedback to the author to steer the poem in a direction you like:
#   - add .with_request_info(agents=[critic])  # Only pause before critic speaks
#     This will allow the human to provide feedback to the agents when the workflow requests it.
#   - Provide feedback to the discussion and observe how the discussion changes.
#
# Just play around with the conversation. You can change the task to be anything you like.
